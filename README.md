I have chosen a design that is simple and easy to read and navigate. The web page and app have a landing page that will give an overview of what “Empowering the Nation” is about and users can begin to explore the courses from there by clicking on the 6 month or 6 week course link to find out more about them. The 2 course pages will have all the relevant information about the individual courses and a link to a sign-up page. Once the user has navigated to the sign-up page they will have the option to select which courses they would like to apply to and be able to click a calculate fees button to display what the fees will be for the chosen courses including VAT and discounts. Each page has a button that links to the contact page where users can view the businesses email, phone number, map and can register an account. The design of the web page and app is made to be easy to navigate and understand for the user by using similar layouts across pages and focusing the main content of each page in the center.
